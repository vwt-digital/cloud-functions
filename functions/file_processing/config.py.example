# JSON_ELEMENTS is used when reading data from JSON where the top-level is an object instead
# of a list. The list containing the data to load is the value of an attribute of the top-level object.
# For example, setting JSON_ELEMENTS to rows, will load this JSON: {"rows": [{"field1": "value1"}] }
# If the JSON data top-level object is a list (like [{"field1": "value1"}]), then JSON_ELEMENTS should
# not be declared.
